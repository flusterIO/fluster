# How to contribute


Thank you so much for considering helping Fluster. As I've said elsewhere, at the time of writing this (June 9th, 2025) I've been homeless for more than 3 years after leaving a career in software behind to work on the modified model of relativity you can find via the `command palette > Documentation{:txt}`.

As you can imagine, when somebody is homeless with $0.22 to their name, every little bit helps. Your support will allow me to continue working on Fluster, turning Fluster into a truly unmatched academic tool.

## My Promise

Regardless of the support Fluster receives, Fluster will always be free and open source for user's running Fluster locally. Future integrations might include first party remote server access, whether for hosting a remote database or for running computationally expensive AI workflows, but this functionality will always be an optional add-on. 

The first rendition of Fluster implements AI through Ollama for this very reason: I want Fluster to be accessible to everyone, first and foremost, regardless of anyone's ability to pay.

With that being said, I gave up a well paying career to work on this model from my formal field of education in physics and astrophysics, and everything I own is in the car that I sleep in, with 180,000 miles on it. Whether you support Fluster financially or by sharing it with others, your support means more than you can imagine.

Thank you, whether you decide to support Fluster or not, I appreciate you taking the time to read this and to learn more about this project. The origin story is certainly atypical, but with your support and the support of others we can develop an umatched academic tool while we revolutionize our understanding of gravity. Sound like something you want to be a part of?
