# You found this!

That's great, because I ***really*** need your help. Almost 4 years ago I quit my job in software to write a paper in my formal field of education, physics after I had an epiphany regarding some of Einstein's earliest work and saw the potential that this modification has. Due to this I've been homeless for several years, and instead of returning to work I decided to take a gamble and build this application to draw attention to this model.

This model truly can change the world, as grandiose as that sounds... I just need people to pay attention, and that's where you come in! What do I need from you? Just talk about this model... show people where you found it, and express your honest opinion about it. The model will speak for itself, and I'm prepared to defend this against any academic. It just so happens to be that academics don't like publishing work that makes theirs obsolete, so I've had to go about this in a bit of a round-about way.

## You in?

So, do you mind if I share the model with you? The model is rock solid, satisfies every single experimental validation of either the specialized or generalized theories of relativity, and does so using purely Newtonian mechanics. It predicts the lens seen in the bullet cluster, which is otherwise anomalous, derives a direct physical mechanism to the equivalence principle, and gives at least 2 (possibly 3) distinct quantities to an error of less than 0.5% of the mean.

To be clear, I'm saying that we can derive multiple values from our local gravitational acceleration and this modification to Einstein's special relativity, and these values actually do align with direct observation to incredible accuracy.

Don't worry if you're not super familiar with the subject, I'll walk you through the derivation. This in fact is the only reason Fluster exists... I built an early version for myself as a personal application while I worked on this modified model of relativity. The only problem? Gravity becomes a repulsive force. You try getting that past peer review in the current academic culture...

## The Model

Ok, so this is $\gamma$ (_gamma_).

$$
\begin{align}
 \gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}
\end{align}
$$

$\gamma$ is the quantity that we use to dilate time due to relative motion. If you're moving in relative motion, you will experience $\gamma t$ units of time while I at relative rest experience $t$... or _so we thought_.

This model that has given us incredibly accurate GPS & modern air travel has a rather glaring flaw; **relativistic synchronicity**.

See, there are a slew of paradoxes that arise from this model of relativity, and most if not all arise from this concept.

Let me break that bit down, explain why this doesn't make sense and what the solution _must_ be.

## The Epiphany

So here in Milwaukee there's what was formerly the biggest clock tower in the world. A little more than 3 years ago I was sitting in a park, looking at the lighthouse ~200 meters to my left, and the clock tower a couple kilometers to my right.

If I ask you to travel between that lighthouse and that clock tower and some velocity that we agree to, what time do you reach the clock tower? Classical models tell us the solution should be $t = d/v$, but this can't be. Multiple experiments demonstrate the validity of $\gamma$, even if the application is flawed. We **know** that you must reach the clock tower in $t = d/v \gamma$, _not_ $t = d/v$.

From this we can draw some conclusions...

First, if we are both using the same time keeping device (the clock tower), you and I _must_ observe you reaching this clock tower at the same time. Relativistic synchronicity says otherwise, but how can it be that you would arrive at the time keeping device and report back to me with a different time? Think about this... if there was another person at the clock tower with a camera with an almost infinite frame rate, such that it can capture the precise time at which you are close to the clock tower, can you possibly bring back a photo that disagrees with the time at which I see you arrive? If we both capture a photo of the same unit of time, how can you arriving at the clock tower differ between the two images?

There are no relativistic effects that can take place here. The image returned from the clock tower to me at relative rest experiences no relativistic effects, and as the observer in relative motion approaches the clock tower the elapsed time between the clock tower and the photon approaching the observer in relative motion approaches zero, likewise omitting any possible relativistic effect.

## The Breakthrough

If we allow that this time $t = d/v \gamma$, as we can prove experimentally, the _only_ possible explanation for this phenomenon is that the distance is longer for you in relative motion than it is for me. But _woah...._, that sounds like cosmic inflation? The thing that gives us the concept of the Big Bang...

Anyone familiar with relativity understands just how fundamental what is known as the 'equivalence principle' was to the establishment of general relativity. This principle simple says that an observer on the surface of a massive body will experience a force that is indistinguishable from the force experienced on an upward accelerating platform of the same magnitude.

Before we can work on deriving a velocity, we must first define what we're deriving this velocity relative to. A loaf of raisin bread or a blueberry muffin placed in an oven are common analogies for cosmic inflation, as they accurately describe the way every position is moving away from every other position as the loaf or muffin expands. If we extrapolate this to the Universe, we can see that as long as the muffin is not in motion along any other axis relative to the oven, there is one point within that muffin that does not move relative to the oven. Let's call that point $p_{\alpha}$.

If we solve $\gamma$ for $v$, we find:

$$
\begin{align}
   v_{0} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\gamma^{2}}}
\end{align}
$$


We might now ask, what $\gamma$ would we need to produce to experience our local gravitational parameters? We can find that quite easily:

First, let's differentiate our equation for gravity with respect to radius:

$$
\begin{align}
   \frac{d}{dR} \left[- G \frac{M}{R^{2}} \right] = 2 G \frac{M}{R^{3}}
\end{align}
$$


If we then divide take the average of the integral, in this case just our original equation for $g$ divided by $R$, we find:

$$
\begin{align}
 \frac{1}{R} \int_0^{R} 2 G \frac{M}{R^{3}} = 1 + \frac{g}{R}
\end{align}
$$

This then gives us a quantity which we can apply as a scalar of distance, just as $\gamma$ was applied as a scalar of time.

If we now go back and substitute this equation in for $\gamma$, we find:

$$
\begin{align}
   v_{0} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{g}{R} \right)^{2}}} = 526.6 ~ \text{km} ~ \text{s}^{-1}
\end{align}
$$

This quantity fit's almost perfectly on top of probability curves found by studies correlating our velocity relative to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) with standard candle surveys, but we can do better... we can derive the velocity relative to the CMB as well.

See, standard candle observations occur at such large distances that cosmic inflation is accounted for within the result. The CMB however, is what is known as kinematic, meaning there are no magical secondary effects due to the dilation of space. If this is true, this same principle should apply to the dilation of space I am proposing. I am trying to unify this proposed dilation of space with cosmic inflation after all.

## The Gravitational Nature of Time

To tackle this kinematic velocity we should first ask, what exactly is time? A fundamental part of reality, at least as far as we know, is that no 2 bodies can occupy all of the same coordinates at the same time. You might be on the same floor as somebody, separated by an x & y coordinate, or you might be a floor above somebody, sharing the same x & y coordinate but now differing by a z coordinate. Time should follow a similar principle, allowing observers can share all 3 spatial coordinates separated only by the fourth, time coordinate.

But here's the thing... we don't need this anymore! We now have this 4th coordinate given by varied rates of travel across this axis of varying spatial density. The fact that two observers who originally share a temporal coordinate can no longer share a temporal coordinate after one experiences some relativistic effect that is not experienced by the other indicates that this axis _must _ be concurrent.

As we no longer need time to occupy this 4th coordinate, there is no need for time at all. Let's then replace time with some _'time equivalent'_ quantities.

Let's allow that for each body in relative motion, each velocity is compared only to the magnitude of other velocities. This means that for a photon with velocity $c$, for each unit of length $d$ this photon progress, each body will move a distance $v d/c$.

This gives a time equivalent quantity of:

$$
\begin{align}
 \tau = \frac{\int_p x}{\int x}
\end{align}
$$

The above notation is likely unclear, so let me explain further. The integral with the subscript $p$ is meant to indicate a _proportional_ derivative, meaning that these integrals are integrated as part of a single process, where each $dx$ is shared proportionally. The normal integral of $x$ dictates the distance traveled in 1 unit of time in our traditional sense. 

It's important to note here that the usage of a classical unit of time is completely arbitrary, and makes sense only to the point that it satisfies our existing units of measure.


From this time equivalent quantity, we might consider the free fall equation for gravity, likewise depicting an observer who is unaffected by the force of expanding nearby bodies.

Let's again calculate our velocity relative to $p_{\alpha}$, but this time taking into account the passage of time.

$$
\begin{align} 
 \frac{1}{R} \int_0^{R} 2 G \frac{M}{R^{3}} \Rightarrow  \frac{1}{R} \int\int_0^{R} 2 G \frac{M}{R^{3}} \tau ~ dR ~ d \tau
\end{align}
$$


$$
\begin{align}
   v_{0} = c \sqrt{1 - \frac{1}{\left( 1 + \frac{1}{2} \frac{g}{R} \right)^{2}}} = 371.5 ~ \text{km} ~ \text{s}^{-1}
\end{align}
$$


Where as our measurements relative to standard candles inherently contains a large measurement error, our velocity relative to the CMB is known with much greater accuracy. This model falls within 0.5% of direct observation and is found through a mechanism which current theories say doesn't exist.


## Follow-Up

I want to keep this page short, as I know most will just glance over this, but if you can, please consider sharing this article. I went from a cozy life in a nice condo to sleeping in my car so I could spend every waking minute working on this model, but I need your help forcing this model into the debate. 

I can defend this model against anyone, but I need you to help me make that debate happen.
