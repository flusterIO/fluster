# Special Files

### Ignoring Things
> `<My Notes Directory>/.flusterIgnore`

You can create a `.flusterIgnore` file in the root of your notes directory to specify file paths that fluster should, you know... ignore. The syntax is identical to that of a `.gitignore` file, with the docs available [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore);

### Bibliography
> `<My Notes Directory>/citations.bib`

By default Fluster includes support for an embedded bibliography database. This database can work in sync with a local file, reading from this file to populate your database. You can still use this database without a local file, but if you have an existing bibliography file place it in your notes directory, and point Fluster to this file in your settings.
