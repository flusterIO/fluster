# Fluster License

While I plan to fully open source this project according to the [open source initive's](https://opensource.org/definition-annotated) definition of open source, which includes free and open redistribution, given my current living situation and the desire to grow a strong community around this project, I've decided to limit the reuse, re-purposing, sale and redistribution of this project to the Fluster ecosystem.

This means that anyone, for any purpose can alter this code for their own personal use, or for the use of someone with whom they share a personal relationship with, be that a classmate, a personal friend or a colleague.

Anyone, at any time can submit a pull request with their alterations, and if those modifications are deemed to be beneficial to the larger Fluster community, those alterations will make it into the production version of Fluster quickly.

The goal is to build a strong community of developers and general learners to contribute to a single, open source project, making Fluster in time the go-to application for any type of academic pursuit. No contribution is too small, and Fluster should be seen as a community project.

The Architecture of Fluster was designed to encourage the growth of a community of developers with React experience, giving these developers the ability to contribute through plugins, with which they are free to do as they like (given that they follow the developer code of conduct), but contributing to the dart and rust parts of Fluster still requires a pull request.

In short, contribute, don't redistribute.

Fluster is now and will forever be open source and free when used on one's own device. While integrations to a paid server may be offered in the future, running Fluster on one's own computer will always be free.

Fluster, or any app that may take it's place will grow faster and become more capable if we all contribute to a single code base. Let's make sure that nobody ever has an idea that they can't convey through their computer, and make Fluster truly amazing together.

## The Bullet Points

- Alter it all you want for your personal use, but don't redistribute it beyond your personal circle of friends (not your internet friends).
- Definitely don't use anything within this repo or codebase for financial gain.
- Make your modifications available to the Fluster community through plugins and pull requests. Your pull requests will be reviewed promptly, and changes to Fluster happen almost daily n it's current state of development, making any pull requests that are beneficial to the greater community available within days.

Let's make Fluster a true community project that serves students, researchers and learners of all types, together.
